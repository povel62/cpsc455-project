#  Project Description
## This project is designed to support Blackbox ML users that will allow a fluid user experience and quick and easy access to the machine learning systems. Our goal is to provide easy access to world-class predictive automated machine learning systems to the masses. We aim to support both general and advanced users equally in using the system to solve their inference problems. Our stretch goal is to allow integration and use with Kaggle to making using the system even easier.
