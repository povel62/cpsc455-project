#  Project Description
## This project is for everyone who likes to gamble/buy lottery or win cool products. It will let its users bid some money for a chance of winning a product. It will store user data, product data and the tokens invested. This will let users keep track of their token bidding on older products and also check newer featured products. We can add more sophisticated features like live timing and winning probability. Some features can be different types of transactions like auctions/charity.
