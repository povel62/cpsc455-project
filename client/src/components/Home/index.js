      <h1>BLACK BOX ML</h1>
      <p>
        BlackBox Machine Learning is an online platform that uses an ensemble of
        state-of-the-art AutoML systems to find the best model to describe your
        data. AutoML is a technique for intelligently trying and selecting
        models in order to perform predictions, regressions, and
        classifications. The models considered in this ensemble range from
        artificial neural networks to simple linear regression, and everything
        in between such as random forests, support vector machines, and
        principal component analysis. Once our system has found a best model,
        you can use it for lightning fast inference of any future samples of
        your dataset.
